		<title>Introduction</title>
		
		<para>
			In RapidDataMapper there are no configuration files, instead it uses <abbrev>PHP</abbrev> objects
			for storing the configuration.
			This enables a lot of customization as classes makes it possible to modify their behaviour by sub-classing.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			The objects which contain the configurations are called descriptors, this is because they describe the mapping.
			All descriptors are either instances of Db_Descriptor or instances of a descendant class.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			The Db_Descriptor class contains a lot of default values and assumptions,
			some of them are modifiable by changing properties or calling methods,
			others are modifiable by overriding one or several methods in a child class.
			This not only enables a user to have a simple and powerful way to configure a mapping,
			it also enables the user to create his own default descriptor settings with a subclass which
			is then used as the base class for his descriptors.
