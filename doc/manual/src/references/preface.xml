		This is the manual for the <link xlink:href="http://www.php.net">PHP</link> library <application>RapidDataMapper</application>.

		I created <application>RapidDataMapper</application> as my exam-work for my last year in
		upper secondary school, as I already had experimented with Object-Relational-Mappers before then.
		Previous experiments utilized an existing database abstraction and added additional features to
		that. But I wanted something more adaptable, better performing and finally to have better control
		over the whole stack, from the calls to <function>mysql_query()</function> and upwards.

		At school we had to do an assignment which spans a whole year, it should take around 100 hours totally
		(I have probably exceeded that requirement :) ).
		I figured; why not do an ORM as assignment, when I will create one even if I don't do it as an assignment?

		As examples I will use a simple database which is cataloguing music.
		This is because examples with forums or similar thins with users etc. have been used a lot
		and I want to do something different.
		The examples are still usable in a real-life application.

		And of course I will use names from bands I listen to a lot :)
